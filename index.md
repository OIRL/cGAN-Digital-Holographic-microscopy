## cGAN QPI-DHM
### Quantitative phase imaging using a digital holographic microscope and a generative adversarial network

The conventional quantitative phase reconstruction in off-axis Digital Holographic Microscopy (DHM) relies on computational processing. Regardless the implementation, any DHM computational processing leads to large processing times, hampering the use of DHM to video-rate renderings of dynamic biological processes. In this work, a conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN) for robust and fast quantitative phase imaging in DHM is reported. The reconstructed phase images provided by the GAN model present stable background levels, enhancing the visualization of the specimens for different experimental conditions. The proposed learning-based method has been trained and validated using human red blood cells. After proper training, the proposed GAN yields to a computationally efficient method, reconstructing DHM images 7X faster than conventional computational approaches.
